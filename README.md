# waste_classification
A deep learning model for classifying waste into 10 categories and detecting multiple objects in a single image, using a custom CNN, task‑tailored metrics and other stuff.

## src
- **`regular_cnn.py`**: Starts with a simple CNN and evolves into a ResNet‑style CNN with residual blocks.
- **`fom.py`**: Full pipeline with task‑tailored FoM and multi‑object detection.

## Features
- 10‑class waste classification
- Residual blocks for deeper training
- Task‑tailored Figure of Merit (FoM) for hazardous item recall
- Class weights and offline data augmentation
- Multi‑object detection using Selective Search, edge‑density filtering, batch inference, and NMS

## Model Architecture
Below is the architecture of the first regular CNN model:
